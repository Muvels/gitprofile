# GitProfile
ðŸŽ¨ Personalize your Profile Readme.md with CSS / TailwindCss


## About GitProfile
GitProfile renders HTML and CSS code for your README file of your profile, the special thing about GitProfile is that it also takes CSS into account when rendering the content. Which gives you infinitely more freedom in designing your README pages than the GitHub markdown renderer does.

## GitProfile Example
<img src="https://gitprofilerender.vercel.app/?username=Muvels"/>


## Usage
Since the rendered HTML code is later output as an SVG, the rendered content can be displayed on the README page via an image. The content is rendered JIT (Just in Time) each time. Therefore also dynamic content or changes in the layout are displayed directly.

Use GitProfile:
- Create a layout.html file in the `main` branch of your repository and write its content.
- In your GitHub file `ReadMe.md` add an image linked to the GitProfile URL.

That's it, now your layout page is rendered via GitProfile and you can use HTML and CSS.


## GitProfile Parameters

- `username` | **Connection to the correct User Profile** [*Required* ]

## Update Rendering Approach - 06.03.2024

GitProfile now renders with vercels satori library under the hood, instead of the slower puppeteer library, which results in way faster loading times, since we do not need to start a new puppeteer instance each time.

-   With this update, you can even use TailwindCSS and include external image sources.
